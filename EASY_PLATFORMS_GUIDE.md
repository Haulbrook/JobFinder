- Don't just search "Google Apps Script"
- Search broader: automation, API, integration, backend
- Many jobs don't mention specific tools

### 2. Read Between the Lines
Job says: "Build integrations between systems"
Translation: API integration work (your specialty!)

Job says: "Automate business processes"
Translation: Workflow automation (you've done this!)

Job says: "Backend developer for SaaS product"
Translation: APIs, integrations, automation (perfect!)

### 3. Don't Self-Reject
If job says "5 years" and you have 4, APPLY ANYWAY!
If job says "degree preferred" and you don't have one, APPLY ANYWAY!
Let them reject you - don't reject yourself!

### 4. Use "Easy Apply" on LinkedIn
- Takes 1 click
- No cover letter needed initially
- Can always elaborate if they respond
- Apply to 20 jobs in 10 minutes!
